# Multilinear_SVD_Exercises
Codes and Function for Multilinear SVD Exercises. Please see "QuestionsTester1to5.m" to test the functions.  
These Questions were designed by Hussam Al Daas and  implemented by Bryce Shirley with help from Hussam Al Daas.

Question 1 - various implementations of the SVD is used to compute the SVD 
of the matrix product AB^T and a function is created to find the mode-n 
unfoldings of a 3D tensors.

Question 2-4 - An implenetation of the Multilinear SVD outlined in "A 
MULTILINEAR SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION" by LIEVEN DE LATHAUWER, BART DE 
MOOR and JOOS VANDEWALLE.

Question 5 - An implementation of Questions 2-4 Multilinear SVD with the 
the extension of Truncated SVDs.

Question 6 - An implementation of Questions 2-4 Multilinear SVD with the 
the extension of Randomized Truncated SVDs.

QuestionsTester.m can be used to test the functions for the questions above. The file has been separated into 
subsections for each question.
